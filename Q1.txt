Q1. What are Smart Contracts?

Ans:

Smart contracts are self executing programs which are written in solidity programming lanugage for
EVM based chians. Smart contracts once deployed onto the network (ethereum block chain) can not
be altered or modified. The are executed on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). Functions in smart
contracts can be called by anyone (if not restricted) and will cost gas if the function modifies
state. Smart contracts can be developed just using a text editor but it is recomended to use 
smart contract develpment frameworks such as truffle and hardhat which makes it super easy to develop,
test and deploy our smart contracts to the chain.
